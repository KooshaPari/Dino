"""Orphan Process Handle Leakage detector — Pattern #102 CI gate.

Pattern #102 ("orphan ``Process.Start()`` handle leak") is the failure
mode where C# code spawns a child process but discards the handle, or
keeps the handle in a field whose lifecycle is not protected by a
try/catch around the spawn:

    // BAD: handle is dropped on the floor; the OS handle is GC'd
    // non-deterministically, and the child process may outlive the
    // parent or accumulate as a zombie.
    Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo { FileName = "blender", ... });

    // BAD: assigned to a field, but if `await ConnectAsync()` throws
    // we leak `_gameProcess` because there's no try/catch around the
    // spawn. The next caller sees a stale field; the spawned process
    // is still running.
    public async Task LaunchAsync()
    {
        _gameProcess = Process.Start(psi);
        await ConnectAsync();
    }

This is a problem for several reasons:

  * **Handle leak**. ``Process`` implements ``IDisposable``; the OS
    handle is closed on dispose. Discarding the result skips dispose
    and relies on finalizer-thread GC.
  * **Zombie processes**. On Windows the child process inherits the
    parent's job-object semantics only if explicit. A discarded handle
    means the child can outlive a crash of the parent — common when
    spawning helper EXEs in a CI runner.
  * **Throw-after-spawn corruption**. The deadliest variant: the
    handle IS captured into a field, but a method-local ``await`` (or
    sync call) between the spawn and a try/catch boundary throws,
    leaving the field set with a stale ``Process`` whose lifecycle is
    no longer connected to the caller's scope.

The healthy patterns are:

  1. ``using var p = Process.Start(...);`` — deterministic dispose at
     scope-end. Use when the spawn is local.
  2. Field assignment INSIDE a ``try { ... } catch { proc?.Kill(); proc?.Dispose(); }``
     wrapper, with the catch killing+disposing on failure. Use when
     the field needs to outlive the spawning method.
  3. Discard with rationale: ``using var _ = Process.Start(...);`` —
     intentional fire-and-forget that still respects ``IDisposable``.

This gate scans ``src/`` for ``Process.Start(...)`` references and
classifies each by call-site shape:

  * **HIGH** — fire-and-forget (no LHS) in core code (``src/Bridge/``,
    ``src/Runtime/``, ``src/SDK/``) — these are platform layers; we
    can't afford handle leaks. Also: field-assignment forms with an
    intervening ``await``/``throw``/method-end before any covering
    ``try { ... }`` and ``catch`` that calls ``Kill()`` or ``Dispose()``.
  * **MED**  — fire-and-forget (no LHS) in non-core code (``src/Tools/``,
    ``src/Tests/``). Cosmetic browser-open / shell-execute is a common
    legitimate case; the fix is to wrap with ``using var _`` for handle
    hygiene.
  * **LOW**  — statement-level discard outside the scopes above. We
    record but don't gate.

Auto-skipped sites (zero recorded as hits):

  * ``using var <name> = Process.Start(...);`` — IDisposable scope
    handles dispose deterministically.
  * Trailing comment ``// pattern-102-allowed: <reason>`` blesses a
    site with rationale.
  * File path in ``docs/qa/orphan-process-start-allowlist.txt``.
  * ``src/Tests/Integration/`` — process-orchestration tests legitimately
    spawn helpers without long-lived field ownership.

Allowlisting (one entry per line, ``#`` for comments):
``docs/qa/orphan-process-start-allowlist.txt``. Two entry forms:

  1. ``severity|file|line`` — line-locked allowlist key.
  2. Bare ``relative/path.cs`` — suppress every site in that file.

CLI:
    python scripts/ci/detect_orphan_process_start.py
        [--root <src/>]
        [--allowlist <path>]
        [--output <json>]
        [--strict]
        [--quiet|--verbose]
        [--self-test]

Exit 0 = no NEW (un-allowlisted) HIGH hits; 1 = new violations
detected (CI fails); 2 = scan/usage error. ``--strict`` promotes MED
findings to fail the gate as well.

Modeled on ``scripts/ci/detect_stringly_enums.py`` (#291),
``scripts/ci/detect_direct_datetime.py`` (#286), and
``scripts/ci/detect_missing_configureawait.py`` (#275). Pairs with the
top-4 HIGH/MED sweep being driven by #295 and the
``using var _`` cleanup being driven by #296.

This is task #297.
