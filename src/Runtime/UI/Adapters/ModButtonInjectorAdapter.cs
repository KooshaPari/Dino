    /// SEAM where Native and Extended UI cross. Records intent to wire a vanilla DINO button

    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Per the <see cref="IModButtonInjector"/> contract this is the ONLY place where Native and
    /// Extended UI cross. The native side supplies a <see cref="NativeCanvasHandle"/> (vanilla
    /// DINO canvas), the extended side supplies an <see cref="IModMenuHost"/> (DFCanvas-bound
    /// mod menu host), and this adapter wires them together.
    ///
    /// Phase 2 Dispatch 7 closes the bridge side of the #193 split. The Runtime today routes
    /// the actual native-button rewire through <c>NativeMenuInjector</c> (the legacy IMGUI-era
    /// helper), which is not yet driven from the SDK contract. As of this dispatch the
    /// adapter:
    ///   1. Validates arguments per <see cref="IModButtonInjector"/> (null canvas / null target).
    ///   2. Records the (canvas, target) pair in an internal map keyed by a stable canvas
    ///      identifier so duplicate injections, hot-reload re-injections, and tests can observe
    ///      what was wired. Last-writer-wins on duplicate canvas key — matches the registry
    ///      semantics used by sibling adapters (see <see cref="ModSettingsHostAdapter"/> +
    ///      <see cref="NativeMenuHostAdapter"/>) and lets pack hot-reload swap the target
    ///      cleanly without an explicit unregister.
    ///   3. Returns a <see cref="NativeButtonHandle"/> placeholder so callers (and tests) get
    ///      a valid handle even before <c>NativeMenuInjector</c> is routed through this seam.
    ///
    /// When M11.5 lands, <see cref="InjectModsButtonCore"/> will route into the native-button
    /// adapter (find vanilla "Mods" button, rewire onClick to <c>target.Toggle()</c>) and the
    /// returned handle will wrap the real <c>UnityEngine.UI.Button</c>. Until then the
    /// registration is intent-only — Plugin.cs / DFCanvas wiring will pull from
